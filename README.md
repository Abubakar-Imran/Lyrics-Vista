National Anthem Analysis
Overview
The National Anthem Analysis project is a graphical application developed in Python using the Tkinter library. It provides functionalities to compare existing national anthems and generate new anthem lyrics based on user input or selected countries.

Features
Anthems Comparison
User Input: Select multiple countries to compare their national anthems.
Data Processing: Process anthem data from a CSV file, clean, and tokenize the text.
Text Analysis: Utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like TF-IDF to analyze and extract key features.
Clustering: Apply K-Means clustering to group similar anthems and identify patterns.
Anthem Generation
User Input: Input specific words to generate new anthem lyrics.
OpenAI API: Utilize the OpenAI API for anthem generation based on user-provided prompts.
Word Clouds: Generate word clouds for clusters of anthems, providing visual insights into common themes.
User Interface
Buttons: Clear buttons for anthem comparison, anthem generation, and navigation.
Entry Fields: Allow users to input words for anthem generation.
Labels and Frames: Organize and present information in a visually appealing manner.
Data Visualization
Silhouette Analysis: Visualize silhouette analysis for determining the optimal number of clusters in anthem comparison.
Word Clouds: Present word clouds for each cluster, highlighting prominent words.
Libraries and Tools Used
Tkinter: GUI library for building the application interface.
OpenAI API: Used for natural language processing and anthem generation.
Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, Geopandas: Libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
Scikit-learn: Used for clustering with the K-Means algorithm.
WordCloud: Generates word clouds for visual representation.
How to Use
Clone the repository and install necessary dependencies.
Run the main script (e.g., python main_script.py).
